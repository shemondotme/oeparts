# Changelog — OeParts

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## 1.0.4 — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **A backup abandoned mid-progress could block every future backup AND update indefinitely** — `BackupJanitor::cleanupPartials()` exists precisely to reclaim a run left `running` forever (e.g. an admin navigates away while "Run backup now" is still AJAX-polling, see v1.0.1) and release the shared lock it holds, but nothing ever called it: `BackupRetentionService` explicitly does not ("Failed/partial runs are the BackupJanitor's job, not retention's"), and `BackupDashboard`'s only use of `BackupJanitor` is the unrelated delete action's `purgeFiles()`. A stuck lock made `PreflightService`'s lock check fail for every subsequent update attempt too, surfacing as "Pre-flight failed: A backup or update is already in progress" with no way to resolve it from the UI. Added `oeparts:backup:cleanup-stale` (wraps `cleanupPartials()`) and scheduled it hourly, matching `config('backup.stale_after_seconds')`'s default 1-hour staleness threshold — a stuck lock now self-heals within the hour instead of requiring manual database/filesystem intervention.

## 1.0.3 — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **System Updates page looked download-only — the one-click "Apply update now" button was easy to miss** — the page header still read "One-click updates are coming soon — for now, follow the release notes," stale copy left over from before the one-click apply FSM (Chunk 3.5) shipped, even though `startApply()`/`pollApply()` have worked since. The prominent "Download release" button also rendered above the "Apply update now" section, reinforcing the impression that downloading was the only option. Fixed the header copy to describe the actual one-click flow, moved "Apply update now" to render first (the primary action, matching WordPress-style update UX), and demoted "Download release" to an outlined secondary link labelled "Download release (manual install)" for admins without `apply updates` permission or who prefer a manual install.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **Settings pages had no way back except a small breadcrumb link** — every one of the 34 pages under the Settings cluster (34 concrete `SettingsPage` subclasses + the Activity Log table page) had only Save/Discard/Reset-to-Defaults actions in the form footer; the only path back to the Settings overview was a single-word cluster breadcrumb above the header, easy to miss. `SettingsPage::getHeaderActions()` now adds an explicit "Back to Settings" header action (linking to the cluster index) inherited by every subclass; the 3 pages that already had their own header actions for page-specific tools (`EmailSettings`' Send Test Email, `PaymentSettings`' Test Connection, `PerformanceSettings`' Test Cache) now merge it in via `...parent::getHeaderActions()` instead of overriding it away. `SettingsActivityLog` (which extends `Filament\Pages\Page` directly, not `SettingsPage`, since it's a table page) gets its own copy of the same action for consistency.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **Backup Management — "Run backup now" no longer hangs on "Running"** — the button dispatched `RunBackupJob`, which runs the entire backup (full profile, including `vendor/` by design) synchronously via `Artisan::call('oeparts:backup')`. Under `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync` (the documented shared-hosting setup with no supervisor — README, CLAUDE.md rule #41) this ran the whole backup inline within the web request, blocking well past the web server's/PHP's timeout and leaving the run stuck at `running` with no progress, exactly as the Backup Engine's own chunked design (rule #48) was built to avoid. `BackupDashboard::runNow` now only calls `BackupManager::start()` (fast) and hands off to a new `pollBackup()` method, AJAX-polled one chunk per tick — the same pattern already used by the Update Engine's apply flow (`SystemUpdates::pollApply`). Also resumes polling automatically if the admin reloads the page mid-backup. `RunBackupJob`/`oeparts:backup` are unchanged and still correct for the scheduled cron backup, which has no web-request timeout to respect.
